Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg)

```python
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```
Example 2:
```python
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```
Example 3:
```python
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```
**Result**

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
from typing import Optional

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        count_num = 0
        temp_head = head

        while temp_head:
            count_num += 1
            temp_head = temp_head.next

        temp_head = head

        for i in range(1, count_num - n):
            temp_head = temp_head.next

        if count_num - n == 0:
            if temp_head.next:
                return temp_head.next
            else:
                return None

        if temp_head.next:
            temp_head.next = temp_head.next.next

        return head
