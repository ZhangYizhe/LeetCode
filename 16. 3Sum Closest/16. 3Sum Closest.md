# 16. 3Sum Closest

Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 

Example 1:

```Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```
Example 2:

```Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
```


**Result**

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:

        nums.sort()
        distance = 2**31-1
        res = 0

        for index_first in range(len(nums)):

            index_sec = index_first + 1
            index_third = len(nums) - 1

            while index_sec < index_third:

                sum_num = nums[index_first] + nums[index_sec] + nums[index_third]
                if sum_num == target:
                    return sum_num

                abs_temp_distance = abs(sum_num - target)

                if distance > abs_temp_distance:
                    distance = abs_temp_distance
                    res = sum_num

                if sum_num < target:
                    index_sec += 1
                else:
                    index_third -= 1
        return res
```
