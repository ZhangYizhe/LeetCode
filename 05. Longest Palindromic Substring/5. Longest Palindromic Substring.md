# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

 

Example 1:

```python
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```
Example 2:

```python
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

**Result**

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        res = ""
        resLen = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            # odd situation
            l, r = i, i
            while l >= 0 and r <= (len(s) - 1) and s[l] == s[r]:
                if r - l + 1 > resLen:
                    res = s[l:r+1]
                    resLen = r - l + 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1

            # even situation
            l, r = i, i+1
            while l >= 0 and r <= (len(s) - 1) and s[l] == s[r]:
                if r - l + 1 > resLen:
                    res = s[l:r+1]
                    resLen = r - l + 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1

        return res
```
