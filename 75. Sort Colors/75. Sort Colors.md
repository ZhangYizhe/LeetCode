# 75. Sort Colors

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:

```python
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
Example 2:

```python
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```
 

Constraints:

```python
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
```

**Result**

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """

        numsDict = [0] * 3

        for num in nums:
            numsDict[num] += 1

        nums[:] = [0] * numsDict[0] + [1] * numsDict[1] + [2] * numsDict[2]
```
