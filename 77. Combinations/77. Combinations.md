# 77. Combinations

Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].

You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

```python
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.
```
Example 2:

```python
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: [[1]]
Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.
```
 

Constraints:

```python
1 <= n <= 20
1 <= k <= n
```

**Result**

```python
class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        def recursion(start: int, end: int, rest: int) -> []:
            if rest < 0:
                return None

            allItems = []

            for num in range(start, end):
                subItems = recursion(num + 1, end, rest - 1)
                if subItems == None:
                    allItems += [[num]]
                else:
                    for subNum in subItems:
                            allItems += [[num] + subNum]
            return allItems


        return recursion(1, n + 1, k - 1)
```
